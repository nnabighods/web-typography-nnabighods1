                            <p>The human son of Brom and Selena, although Eragon's true relationship to Brom is not revealed until the third novel. Eragon is the cousin of Roran Garrowsson and half-brother of Murtagh. Until the age of fifteen, he was raised by his uncle Garrow. After the dragon Saphira hatches for him, he travels to the Varden, where he learns of the evils done by Galbatorix and determines to end the king's rule. He has romantic feelings for the elf Arya, but the two never become a couple as he leaves Alagaësia permanently at the end of the final novel. He is also known as Eragon Bromsson, Argetlam, Shur'tugal, Shadeslayer, Firesword, and Kingkiller.</p>

                            <h3>Saphira Bjartskular ("Brightscales")</h3>
                            <p>A female blue dragon who hatches from an egg stolen from Galbatorix by Brom and Jeod. She is the last living female dragon in all of Alagaësia, although more dragon eggs are found at the end of the final novel. Saphira is wise, fearless, protective of Eragon, and somewhat vain. She is also skilled at aerial acrobatics. Her sire was Iormûngr, a bonded dragon, and her dam was Vervanda, a wild dragon.  At the end of Inheritance she mates with Fírnen before leaving Alagaësia with Eragon.</p>

                            <h3>Orik Thrifksson (also known as Grimstborith Orik and King Orik)</h3>
                            <p>a dwarf, a member of the clan Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, and the nephew of King Hrothgar. He becomes king and leader (Grimstborith) of Ingeitum after Hrothgar's death. Orik is a smith, a warrior, and Eragon's guide.  He adopts Eragon into his clan in Eldest. Orik later marries Hvedra, the Grimstcarvlorss of Ingeitum.</p>

                            <h3>Murtagh Morzansson</h3>
                            <p>The human son of Morzan and Selena, Eragon's half-brother. Eragon first meets him in Eragon and travels with him to the Varden, where he is mistrusted for being Morzan's son. In Eldest, Murtagh is kidnapped by the Twins and forced to serve Galbatorix after the dragon Thorn hatches for him. He is an exceptionally skilled swordsman naturally, and has enhanced strength and magic from Galbatorix, as well as his Eldunarí (the source of a dragon's being and life force). Due to his difficult childhood, he has little empathy for others. He has romantic feelings for Nasuada, but does not pursue a relationship as he feels he can never be accepted by society, even after helping to defeat Galbatorix.[9] His name is entirely the author's invention.</p>

                            <h3>Galbatorix</h3>
                            <p>The human king and tyrant of the Empire. When his first dragon, Jarnunvösk was killed by Urgals, Galbatorix began a quest for revenge against the Riders which ultimately resulted in their extinction and his rise to power in the human kingdom. He stole a dragon hatchling named Shruikan and bound their minds in a crude approximation of a Rider's bond. He has derived incredible magical strength from the captured souls of dead dragons, the Eldunarí. He is at least 120 years old.  He is killed in the final novel. Galbatorix's name means "Big King" in Celtic.</p>

                            <p>the daughter of Ajihad and Nadara, human members of the Wandering Tribes. Upon her father's death at the beginning of Eldest, Nasuada becomes leader of the Varden. She is Eragon's liegelord. She is very cunning and trusted by both her people and Eragon, which leads her to become queen of the Empire in Inheritance. Her later decision to force all magic-users to register and be monitored by the government is what drives Eragon to leave Alagaësia.</p>

                            <h3>Roran Garrowsson (Stronghammer)</h3>
                            <p>Eragon's cousin and father of Ismira, who grew up with him in Carvahall with Eragon. Roran has an almost obsession with his eventual-wife, Katrina, which leads him to travel with the whole of Carvahall to join the Varden. He becomes an excellent motivational speaker as a result. Although he at first resents his cousin for inciting war and bringing about Garrow's death, the two make up and become quite close.</p>

                            <h3>Arya Dröttningu</h3>
                            <p>A female elf and is the only daughter of King Evandar and Queen Islanzadí. Arya has served as courier of Saphira's egg and the elves' ambassador to the Varden.[6] She becomes queen of the elves after the death of her mother, as well as a dragon rider (bonded to Fírnen), at the end of the final book. She is also known as Arya Svit-kona and Arya Shadeslayer. Eragon rescues her in the first novel when she is being held captive by Durza, a shade. When Eragon first pursues her romantically, she rebuffs his advances, telling him she had recently lost a close friend, Fäolin, and that any relationship would be unwise because of their respective responsibilities and age differences. She holds traditional human gender roles in disdain.[12] At the end of the final novel, she is willing to consider Eragon as a romantic partner, but he leaves before they can begin a relationship. She shows this by telling her true name to Eragon, which she refused to do before.</p>

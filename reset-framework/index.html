                    Eragon is the first book in The Inheritance Cycle by American fantasy writer Christopher Paolini. Paolini, born in 1983, began 
                    writing the novel after graduating from highschool at age fifteen. After writing the first draft for a year, Paolini spent a second 
                    year rewriting and fleshing out the story and characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 2001 decided to self-publish 
                    Eragon;[2] Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. The book was discovered by novelist Carl 
                    Hiaasen, who got it re-published by Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003. The book tells the 
                    story of a farm boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. The stone is revealed to be a dragon egg, and a 
                    dragon he later names Saphira hatches from it. When the evil King Galbatorix finds out about the egg, he sends monstrous servants 
                    to acquire it, making Eragon and Saphira flee from their hometown with a storyteller named Brom. Brom, an old member of an extinct 
                    group called the Dragon Riders, teaches Eragon about 'The Ways of the Rider.' Eragon was the third-best-selling children's hardback 
                    book of 2003, and the second-best-selling paperback of 2005. It placed on the New York Times Children's Books Best Seller list for 
                    121 weeks and was adapted as a feature film of the same name that was released on December 15, 2006.
